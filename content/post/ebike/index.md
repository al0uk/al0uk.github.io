title: How I converted a Mountain Bike into an e-bike
description: I needed a reliable means of transportation during my time at university, I didn't wanna buy a car and I wanted to tinker on something, so what better than to make take a Walmart Mountain Bike and turn it into an e-bike capable of hauling a full week's worth of groceries across town with ease?
